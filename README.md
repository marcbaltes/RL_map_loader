# RL Epic Games Custom Map Loader
New workaround for Epic Games users to load any custom map into Rocket League via the Steam Workshop

## Installing and Running the App
1. Download or clone this repo
2. Unzip the file and you will see the README.md and the Map Loader folder. Open the Map Loader folder and scroll down until you find 'Map Loader.exe' (or it may just be called 'Map Loader') and double click it to launch the application.

## Usage
1. Create a new folder, name it whatever you want. Just remember where you put it. This will be the folder that stores all your maps
2. Find a map you would like to download on the Steam Workshop (ex: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1671658424&searchtext=rings)
3. Copy the URL of that map and then go to https://steamworkshopdownloader.io/ and paste the link on that website to download the .zip file for the map. 
4. Once the file is downloaded, I suggest renaming it to your liking because the application will use this file's name for the map. Now all you have to do is drag the zipped folder into the folder you made to store your maps.
5. In the app, click the "Locate Rocket League folder" button. By default, the app will scan your C: and D: drives to find the rocket league folder. If it can't find it there then a file browser will pop up and you need to select the location of where Rocket League is on your system. It should be in a folder named 'rocketleague'. When found click Select Folder. 
6. Now click the "Import Maps" button. The file browser will pop up and you need to select the folder you made that holds all your custom maps
7. You should now be all set to select a map. Click one of the maps you've installed on the app and it should light up green, indicating that map is now loaded. To play the map, open Rocket League and select free play under training. I made it so the map you choose replaces the Labs - Underpass map. So in training, select that map and press play. 
8. If you add any maps to the folder while the app is running, you can click the refresh button next to the Import Map button to reload the maps you have downloaded in the folder.
9. In case things go wrong, there is a "Reset Game Files" button. If the map is unplayable or corrupted it may mess up your game and the original Underpass map. If this happens click this button. It will remove the custom map from your game and replace the Underpass map with it's original file. After that everything should be good to go again
